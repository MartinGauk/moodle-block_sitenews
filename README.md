  - In section "Where this block appears"
    * Choose "Display throughout the entire site"
    * Default region: "Content"
    * Default weight as you like
  - In section "On this page" 
    * Hide the block on the startpage by choosing "Visible: No"
4. Go to "My home" and open block configuration for "Site news"
5. Choose to display the block on all pages of type "My home page" and you're done
