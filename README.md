moodle-block_sitenews
=====================

Display site news in full scale at my startpage. You may find it useful to make it sticky above or below the course overview.


Configuration
=============

If you want to display the block at all my-pages (former known as "sticky"-block) follow these steps:

1. Add block "Site news" to the startpage (not "My home page"!)
2. Open block configuration
3. Choose "Display throughout the entire site" with "Content" as default region (default weight as you like). Hide the block on the startpage by choosing "Visible: No" in the "On this page" section.
4. Go to "My home" and open block configuration for "Site news"
5. Choose to display the block on all pages of type "My home page" and you're done
